Executive Summary

Education is the framework for the advancement of our society as a whole. There are so many different factors that go into a child's success in the system. I wanted to take a closer look at these factors, and see if I could determine the things that impact their success the most. We will base our analysis on ACT scores and Graduation rates. Does the proximity to libraries and parks play a roll in success? Do budget trends have any impact year over year? What about teacher to student ratio and social services spending?

First, we will look at the relationship between the operating budget of MNPS, libraries and social services program verses certain metrics. ACT, Graduation.

Then, we will compare attendance rates for schools, and see what impact those have on those metrics. 

Finally, we will look into the effect teachers have, with their experience levels and the student to teacher ratio.
