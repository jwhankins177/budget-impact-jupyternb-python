# capstone
Capstone project for Nashville Software School DA7.

Executive Summary

Using data gathered from various government resources, I seek to find any trends relating to the impact of funds spent on education, environment, health, and safety. I seek to show the correlation of this spending on the overall outcomes of these 4 metrics, over a time period of 10 years.  
Additionally, I will also be comparing these findings with a similar analysis of the 3 major cities in Tennessee, and also compare our state with 2 other states of similar populations, in different regions of the U.S.
Motivation
With this project, I hope to find data to show the overall value of dollars spent in each of these categories; education, environment, health, and safety. Using this information, decision makers will be able to determine the greatest return on investment when making long term budget decisions. 
Data Question
Is there a measurable difference in the metrics representing the overall progress of education, environment, health, and safety based on the allocation of funds in an area's yearly budget?
 
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

With PowerBi, I will use the data gathered, cleaned, analyzed and visualized in python using Jupyter Notebooks, to present a comparison between the operating budgets and any measurable outcome for the categories of education, environment, health, and safety. This will be done for the following areas:
Comparing the three major metropolitan areas of Tennessee; Nashville, Knoxville, and Memphis. 
Comparing states of similar populations in different regions of the U.S.; Tennessee, Washington, and Arizona. 
With all of this information, anyone who contributes to the decision making process for the yearly operating budgets of these regions will be able to assign a clear value for each dollar spent. In addition, they will be able to see both the short and long term impacts of these decisions.

Known Issues and Challenges

Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. Be sure to include:
This may be too much. I plan to do this in phases, starting with just Nashville, then adding in Memphis and Knoxville. After that, time and ability willing, I will add in the other states. This way, if I get halfway through and realize I only can/need to do one, I haven’t wasted any time and will still be on schedule. 

There are a lot of different data sources, from different agencies. The cleaning and merging will take the most time, so I have allocated more time to the front end of the project.

Consistency in reporting will need to be verified to be able to clearly compare different cities and states. 

Covid will have an impact on the data set. To limit this, I am going to go back at least ten years, and make sure to have the time periods that may be affected by covid clearly labeled. Ideally, I will be able to incorporate covid impacts as well, with the changes to schooling, traffic, and the abrupt variations in budgets in every region. I do want to be careful to not let covid take too big of a part of this project though, as it’s impact is unique in its duration and one time nature. Making decisions based strictly off those time periods would not lead to any reproducible results.
